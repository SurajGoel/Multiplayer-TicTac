# Multiplayer-TicTac

This is a small side project done by me.
I have made a small browser TicTac game.

Apart from traditional single player, and two player mode. I have made an attemp to add Online Play mode.

I wrote a backend in nodejs. It's far from the most efficient way, but it is working right now.

 ## Clone project
``npm init``

Change the url for socket connection in ``game.js`` file pointing to your backend.
